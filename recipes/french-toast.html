        <h2>Description</h2>
        This is the best French toast recipe. It's different because it uses flour. I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make!
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup milk</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                <li>12 (3/4- to 1-inch thick) slices of bread</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Place flour into a large mixing bowl; slowly whisk in milk until smooth. Whisk in eggs, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt until well combined.</li>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Meanwhile, soak bread slices in milk mixture until saturated.</li>
                <li>Working in batches, cook bread on the preheated griddle or pan until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
